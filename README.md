# Flash-Card-CEF

To build the project solution for visual studio
clone this repository:
https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef-project/src/master/

edit the CMakeLists.txt, add_subdirectory(FlashCard) then continue to follow the 
instruction from that repository.

Otherwise, build2/FlashCard/Release/FlashCard.exe should run it.
